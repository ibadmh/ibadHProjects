                            for each team member for the duration of the year. This
                            includes "prep' season (Late 2018). "build" season
                            (January 2019 - February 2019) and "game" season (March
                            2019 - April 2019). Each of these 3 time periods will be
                            divided into two phases. Phase I will begin in September
                            of 2018 and will last until the end of build season.
                            Phase 2 will only apply to match days and competition
                            durations. These phases allow the team to be organized
                            and increase the efficiency for each role. They also
                            ensures that team members have roles during both the

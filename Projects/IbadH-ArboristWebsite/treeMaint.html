            <h2>Services:</h2>
            <p>
                The maintenance of your tree is essential to the aesthetics and health of the 
                garden or lawn on your property. We offer many Tree related services from 
                planting, pruning, fertilization, and more!
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><h3>Pruning</h3>
                    <p>Regular pruning is required to keep a tree's growth, structure, and 
                        integrity. A properly trimmed tree reduces the likelihood of broken 
                        limbs and falling branches, as well as the spread of diseases. Our
                         Arborists provide expert tree pruning and trimming services across 
                         Alberta. We ensure that trees and bushes remain healthy for many 
                         years to come because we are aware of the effects that various 
                         treatments have on them. We also pay close attention to the season, 
                         weather, and other factors that may influence the growth of your tree.</p>
                </li>

                <li><h3>Planting</h3>                
                    <p>When looking for tree planting services, the best place to start is 
                        with an arborist who is knowledgeable about the local tree species. 
                        We regularly remind our clients that proper planting is critical to 
                        a tree's safe and healthy growth. Before planting, our arborists will
                         purchase the trees from local nurseries to ensure they have been 
                         exposed to a similar climate. We enjoy serving our residential and 
                         commercial clients with their tree planting needs.</p>
                </li>

                <li><h3>Stump Grinding</h3>
                    <p>Is the process of turning huge surface roots and tree stumps around them 
                        into woodchips at a depth of 18 to 22 inches below grade. We typically advise 
                        tree and stump removal to assist prevent suckering while suckering trees are in full leaf.</p>
                </li>

                <li><h3>Deep Root Fertilization</h3>
                    <p>Deep root fertilization, in essence, facilitates nutrient transport to the root 
                        system, where it is most needed. We recommend applying our all-purpose tree 
                        fertilizer in both the spring and fall. Its composition is made up of 10% 
                        nitrogen, 10% phosphate, and 10% other active nutrients.</p>
                </li>

                <li><h3>Tree Surgery</h3>
                    <p>By installing threaded steel rods and/or high-strength cables in your tree, 
                        you can both repair damage that has already been done and avoid future harm 
                        by maintaining the tree's structural integrity.</p>
                </li>

                <li><h3>Pesticide and Insect Treatment</h3>
                    <p>Our experts will analyze your tree, and, if possible, will help remove all
                         harmfull pests and insects that mightve inhabited it throughout the years</p>
